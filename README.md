# Online Meeting Manger

This was my final year project for my Computer Science degree at Brunel University.
It's a full-stack django web-application with the goal of improving the organisation and management of online meetings. 
It can create, edit, delete and auto-join online meetings with the use of a REST API, the Zoom API and google calendar API. 
Each meeting is added to a google calendar as well. 

## Tech Stack:
It is a CRUD application, with a MVC design mattern. 
The frontend was built using React and class based components. With the UI being built using of Material UI components. 
The backend uses Python and a REST API to take in the data from the frontend in JSON and returning a HTTP code depending on the data passed in.
