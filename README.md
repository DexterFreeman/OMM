# Online Meeting Manger
Online Meeting Manager is a powerful and user-friendly website built for my final year project at Brunel University that has been designed to help individuals and organizations organize and manage their online meetings. With Online Meeting Manager, users can easily create and automate the scheduling of their Zoom meetings. Users can create a new meeting in just a few clicks, and they can also set the date, time, and duration of the meeting. 

One of the key features of Online Meeting Manager is its integration with Google Calendar. The platform automatically adds every new meeting to the user's Google calendar, ensuring that they never miss an appointment or double-book themselves.

Online Meeting Manager also simplifies the process of joining online meetings. Users receive a link to the meeting in the webapp and calendar, which they can easily click to join the meeting. This feature makes it easy for users to join meetings, even if they are not tech-savvy or experienced with online meetings.

Overall, Online Meeting Manager is a valuable tool for anyone who regularly attends or hosts online meetings. With its powerful features and intuitive interface, users can easily manage their online meetings and ensure that they never miss an appointment.

## Tech Stack:
It is a CRUD application, with a MVC design mattern. 
The frontend was built using React and class based components. With the UI being built using Material UI components. 
The backend uses Python and a REST API to take in the data from the frontend in JSON and returning a HTTP code depending on the data passed in.
Web-pack and Babel are used for bandling and converting both the front-end code and backend code for the framework.
